## The short version

If you've been told that "AI search is just SEO with extra steps," that's wrong.

Traditional SEO competes for a position on a list of blue links. AI Visibility is about a different question: when a customer asks ChatGPT "who's the best plumber near me?", does the AI come back with **your business name** — or someone else's?

Same end goal (more customers find you). Completely different mechanism.

## How traditional SEO works

You optimize your site so Google's algorithm decides your page is relevant to a search query. If Google agrees, your URL appears as one of ten links on a results page. The customer scans, picks one, and clicks.

The unit of optimization is **the page**. The unit of result is **a click**.

## How AI engines work

ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude don't return a list of links. They return **an answer**. They name businesses, recommend products, and cite sources. The customer reads the answer and either takes it at face value or asks a follow-up.

The unit of optimization is **the entity** (your business, with everything tied to it: services, location, reviews, FAQs, structured data). The unit of result is **a citation by name**.

A customer asking "best dog groomer in Hartford" doesn't get a list of ten salons. They get something like:

> *"Three top-rated dog groomers in Hartford include Acme Pet Spa (4.9 stars, 312 reviews, specialty cuts), Bark Avenue (4.8 stars, mobile service available), and Paws & Reflect (4.7 stars, full-service grooming)."*

If your business isn't in that recommendation, you don't exist. There's no second page to click to. There's no scrolling.

## What this changes for local businesses

Three things matter more in the AI-recommendation era than they ever did for traditional SEO:

1. **Structured data.** AI engines extract information from JSON-LD schema markup. If your site doesn't have `LocalBusiness` schema with a niche-specific subtype (`VeterinaryCare`, `FuneralHome`, `PetStore`, etc.), you're invisible to the part of the AI that builds recommendations.
2. **Reviews — both quantity and recency.** AI engines weight review velocity. A business with 300 reviews dating to 2018 ranks worse than a business with 80 reviews where the most recent one is from last week.
3. **Plain-language FAQ content.** AI engines extract answers from FAQ schema and from H2/H3 question-answer pairs in your content. Generic copy gets ignored. Specific questions with specific answers get cited.

## What this doesn't change

Traditional SEO still matters. Google still drives most local search traffic in 2026. AI search is the fastest-growing segment, but it hasn't replaced the existing one — it's stacked on top.

What we tell clients: don't choose between the two. Do both. The same structured data lift that helps AI engines recommend you also helps Google rank you. The same reviews work that signals freshness to AI engines also moves you up in the local 3-pack.

## The work, in plain English

For a typical local business client, here's what showing up in AI search actually requires:

- A `LocalBusiness` schema block on your site, with the **specific** subtype for your niche
- An `Organization` schema block
- A `Service` schema block per pillar service you offer
- A `FAQPage` schema block tied to actual customer-facing questions
- An `llms.txt` file in your site root summarizing your business in plain language for AI crawlers
- A `robots.txt` that explicitly allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, and the other major AI crawlers
- NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone — exactly the same string across your site, GBP, and citation directories)
- Active review collection — not in batches, but consistently every week

Most of that work is invisible to your customers. They never see schema markup. But the AI engines do, and they cite the businesses that have it.

## Why most agencies aren't doing this yet

Two reasons:

1. **It's new.** Most agencies built their playbooks for a Google-search world and haven't updated.
2. **Tracking it is harder.** Traditional SEO has Google Search Console + rank-tracking tools. AI citation tracking is a much rougher science — you have to actually run queries against ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews and log who they recommend.

The window of opportunity for being the local business that's recommended by name in AI engines closes the moment competitors catch up. Right now, most don't even know it's a thing.

That's the gap.

If your business runs on local discovery — and you're not visible across both traditional Google and the AI engines — you're losing the customers that ask AI first. We can show you exactly where you stand. [Get a free AI Visibility audit.](/ai-visibility)
