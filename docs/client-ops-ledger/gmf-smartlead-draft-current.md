## SmartLead Settings

- Open tracking disabled: yes
- Click tracking disabled: yes
- Plain text: yes
- Stop on reply: yes
- Suppression import rules: global blocklist, unsubscribe list, duplicate leads, and community bounce list are honored.
- Activation: blocked by this script.
- Sales Manager capacity gate: campaign activation still requires confirmation that Get Found delivery can stay inside 48 hours.
- Channel doctrine: cold email validates the message first; LinkedIn outbound is excluded.

## Actions

- Dry run only; no SmartLead mutation.

## Outputs

- Payload JSON: `C:\Users\micha\Documents\aoh-website\docs\client-ops-ledger\outbox\gmf-smartlead-draft-payload-2026-05-29.json`
- Validation JSON: `C:\Users\micha\Documents\aoh-website\docs\client-ops-ledger\outbox\gmf-smartlead-draft-validation-2026-05-29.json`

## Next Gate

Sender may use this packet only to create or inspect a paused SmartLead draft. Before any activation, run:

```bash
npm run smartlead:deliverability-audit -- --campaign-id <id>
```

Then Auditor reviews the PASS/WATCH/HOLD result and Manager asks Mike for the exact final send approval if no agent-owned blockers remain.
