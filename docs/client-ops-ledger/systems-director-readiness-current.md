## Mike Approval Required

- Vercel account/team/project/domain deletion, merge, or transfer
- Legacy AOH domain removal or redirect
- Paid Supabase PITR or backup-plan changes
- Paid VPS backup/snapshot changes
- Production token rotation
- Database or VPS restore/overwrite

## Agent-Owned Next Actions

- Systems Director runs this check weekly and summarizes only status/proof, not secrets.
- Auditor reviews warnings before client volume grows or before production-sensitive changes.
- Codex updates scripts, docs, and non-destructive workflows when checks identify drift.
- No agent deletes accounts, projects, domains, databases, or VPS state without Mike's explicit approval.
