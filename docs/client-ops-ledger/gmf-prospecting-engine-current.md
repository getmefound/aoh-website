# GMF Prospecting Engine

Date: 2026-05-29
Owner: Manager / Elon
Mode: fixture dry run
Live sends: no

## Exists Vs Missing

Exists in repo: Outscraper base-map discovery, NeverBounce verification, Smartlead warmup/readiness checks, a hardcoded seed campaign script, deliverability audit, reply-router API, free visibility report automation, and SOP guardrails.

Built by this run: GMF-specific config, target niches/geos, single worst-gap segmentation, no-blank personalization suppression, 4-step copy packet, Smartlead-ready CSV, nurture packet, sender-capacity read from warmup data, and reporting templates.

Related event route: `/api/prospecting/events` handles SmartLead/prospecting replies, opt-outs, bounces, complaints, form fills, and purchases behind a token.

Still not live-send complete: Smartlead draft setup should remain paused until `npm run gmf:smartlead-draft`, suppression proof, and deliverability audit are reviewed by Auditor and Mike approves the exact send.

## Guardrails Confirmed

- No live prospect send ran.
- No Smartlead campaign was created, changed, activated, or uploaded.
- LinkedIn outbound is excluded for this ICP.
- No HighLevel AI feature was enabled.
- No per-review Outscraper scraper ran across the full list.
- Scoring calls `/api/visibility-score`; records returning `insufficient_data` or missing safe personalization are suppressed before send.
- Cold emails use outreach domains only; `getmefound.ai` is blocked for cold prospecting senders.
- Cold-email bodies contain no links; the CTA is a reply-YES request. Report URLs are stored as merge fields for the positive-reply auto-response.
- Volume must stay below 48-hour Get Found fulfillment capacity before scale.

## Credentials/APIs Needed

- Outscraper: `OUTSCRAPER_API_KEY` for paid base Google Maps scrape only.
- NoBounce/NeverBounce: `NOBOUNCE_API_KEY` or existing `NEVERBOUNCE_API_KEY` for email verification.
- SmartLead: `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY` for read-only warmup/capacity checks and, after approval, campaign draft/upload.

## Next Agent Actions

1. Sales Manager confirms this batch matches the acquisition playbook: pet-care-first validation, channel fit, and capacity gate.
2. Scout runs this engine with `--allow-spend --verify` only after the spend gate is approved or already documented.
3. Sender runs `npm run gmf:smartlead-draft -- --csv tmp-gmf-prospecting-smartlead-ready-2026-05-29.csv` to build the paused Smartlead draft packet.
4. Reporter runs `npm run gmf:guardrails` after metrics exist.
5. Auditor reviews sequence, footer, one-link rule, suppression, sender capacity, deliverability audit, and fulfillment-capacity risk.
6. Manager asks Mike by Slack DM for final live-send approval only after the approval packet is complete.
