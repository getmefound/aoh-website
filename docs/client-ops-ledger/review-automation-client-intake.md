# Review Automation Client Intake

Status: v1 live intake
Owner: Manager
Primary agents: Profile Manager, Reviews Manager, Systems Director, GHL Expert bridge
Last updated: 2026-05-21

## Purpose

This form lets a client tell AOH they are ready for setup.

The important trigger is Google Business Profile access:

- client adds the AOH business-domain Google login as Manager
- client submits the intake form
- Manager routes the setup packet to the right agents
- Profile Manager verifies access
- Reviews Manager prepares the review automation flow
- Systems Director keeps the AOH-owned intake/alert path healthy
- GHL Expert handles HighLevel only as a bridge while the GHL exit is in progress

## Live Form

```text
/intake/review-automation
```

## Intake Routing

When the form is submitted, the API forwards a setup packet to:

- `AOH_CLIENT_INTAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`, if set
- otherwise `AOH_INTAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`, if set
- `SLACK_CLIENT_INTAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`, if set
- otherwise `SLACK_MISSION_CONTROL_WEBHOOK_URL` or `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `GHL_CLIENT_INTAKE_WEBHOOK_URL`, `GHL_CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL`, or
  `GHL_WEBHOOK_URL` only as the temporary GHL bridge

Bridge control:

```text
AOH_DISABLE_GHL_FORWARDING=yes
```

Use that when AOH is ready to stop sending new intake packets into GHL.

## Client Access Language

Use Manager access by default.

Client-facing language:

```text
Add our business email as Manager in Google Business Profile settings under People and access. We do not need your Google password.
```

Owner access is not the default. If a client selects Owner, Manager should flag it for review and confirm why it was needed.

## Agent Workflow

1. Client submits intake form.
2. Manager receives setup packet.
3. Profile Manager checks GBP access and profile basics.
4. Reviews Manager prepares review automation setup.
5. Systems Director confirms the AOH-owned intake/alert path received the packet.
6. GHL Expert prepares HighLevel setup only if the GHL bridge is still active.
7. Manager reports ready, blocked, or needs client help.

## Safety Rules

- No password sharing.
- Default GBP role is Manager.
- Public Google profile changes need approval before publishing.
- HighLevel AI features stay OFF unless Mike manually approves them.
- GHL forwarding is temporary and can be disabled without changing the client form.
